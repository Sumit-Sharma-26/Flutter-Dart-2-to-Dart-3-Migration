# Flutter Dart 2 to Dart 3 Migration

Migrating a Flutter application from Dart 2 to Dart 3 involves updating your codebase to align with the changes introduced in Dart 3. This guide provides a structured approach to help you through the migration process.

## Step-by-Step Migration Guide

Follow these steps to migrate your Flutter application smoothly:

1. **Understand the Changes**
   - Familiarize yourself with the changes between Dart 2 and Dart 3.
   - Key changes include null safety improvements, language syntax updates, and possible breaking changes in libraries.

2. **Update Dependencies**
   - Ensure all packages and dependencies used in your Flutter project are compatible with Dart 3.
   - Check their respective documentation and release notes for guidance.

3. **Enable Null Safety**
   - Update your `pubspec.yaml` file to specify Dart 3 and enable null safety for your project.
   - Example:

     ```yaml
     environment:
       sdk: ">=3.0.0 <4.0.0"
     ```

4. **Use Dart Migration Tool**
   - Utilize the Dart migration tool (`dart migrate`) to automate some updates.
   - This tool assists in converting your Dart 2 code to Dart 3, especially for null safety and syntax changes.
   - Command:

     ```bash
     dart migrate --apply-changes
     ```

5. **Manual Code Changes**
   - Address changes that require manual intervention, such as updating deprecated APIs or handling breaking changes in libraries.

6. **Testing and Validation**
   - Run your application frequently during the migration process.
   - Use unit tests and integration tests to ensure that functionality remains intact after each update.
